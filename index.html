                <h3>GitHub Repositories</h3>
                <p>A Java application designed to retrieve and display information about a user's GitHub repositories,
                    specifically non-fork repositories and their branches. It connects to the GitHub API to gather
                    repository data such as the repository name, owner's login, and branch details (branch name and last
                    commit SHA). The application temporarily stores this information in a MongoDB database for 1 hour to
                    minimize redundant API calls and improve performance.</p>
                <p>Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, JUnit, Mockito, MockWebServer, Docker Compose, REST API</p>

                <h3>Library Management Application</h3>
                <p>A Java application to manage a library’s inventory and customer data, allowing for the borrowing and
                    returning of books. The application stores information about books and customers, along with each
                    customer’s loan history, including dates for borrowed and returned books. I used Java with the
                    Spring Boot framework to create RESTful services, and MongoDB as the database to store the
                    information.</p>

                <h3>Android Application for Identifying Instruments</h3>
                <p>An Android application designed to identify musical instruments based on
                    recorded sounds. Users can send audio through the app to a server,
                    where a machine learning algorithm processes the sound and returns the instrument's name. The app is
                    built in Kotlin, while the server, implemented in Python, handles audio analysis using machine
                    learning model. The application was part of my master's thesis and provides users with a simple,
                    intuitive interface for uploading and analyzing sound files.</p>
                <p>Technologies: Kotlin, Python (server-side)</p>

                <h3>Social Network Application</h3>
                <p>The Social Network Application is a web platform designed to enable users to create posts and
                    interact with others through likes. Users can register, log in, and post updates. While initially
                    planned to include features like comments and friends lists, the core functionalities focused on
                    creating and liking posts.
                    The backend is built using Java and Spring Boot for RESTful API services. Spring Security ensures
                    user authentication and authorization, and MySQL is used for data storage, including user profiles
                    and posts. Swagger was used for API documentation. Project development was managed using Git for
                    version control and Jira for task organization and team collaboration.</p>

                <p>A web application built for managing an online bookstore, allowing users to
                    browse, purchase books, and make secure payments. The application integrates with the PayU payment
                    system to handle online transactions. It includes features such as user authentication, book
                    inventory management, order processing, and a shopping cart. Administrators can manage book
                    listings, view sales reports, and update inventory. The application has a frontend built using JSP
                    files for dynamic web pages and a user-friendly interface.</p>
